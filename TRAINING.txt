Testing :

check whether the actual(created by developers) product matches the customer's requirements.

IMPORTANT OF TESTING :  

whether it contains bug-free or not
whether we missed any requirements


REASON FOR TESTING :

find bugs in an earlier stage 
quality of product
secured product 
enhancing the quality (requirements )
enhancing the security 

Types of Testing :

static - testing before completing the code, is just verification, to check whether the product  is crt or not, reviews, inspections 
dynamics - testing after compilation / it checks the code.

dynamic => 1.Functional , 2.Non functional 
 
functional - how to system behaves or works,
to check the system behaviors - there are two ways: white box testing and black box testing 
black box: only test with input and output, we will not have code, commonly these are used by testers 
white-box: check by code, mostly used by developers.


Non Functional: check how was the scalability usability  performance, how it can be recovered from risk


Other types of testing :
 Manual testing, Automation testing 
In manual testing  : we debug the code  manually 
In automation testing :   it have some automation tools , we have to write a scripts for the testing and  execute  it

Advantage ofmanual testing :
Accurate feedback, less expensive,visual testing , debugging is easier 


Automation testing :
Accurate product , can be test parallel , less Time , reporting is easy, increase in productivity and quality 


WHEN?:
Not all the time automation testing used . Automaton were used only when these factors are  available 

=>Repetitive task (like fb  task)
=>Functional testing 
=>Oerformance and load testing (what when more number of user use that application at the time )
=>Advanced GUI -Like face recoginization
